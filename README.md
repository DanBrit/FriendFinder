# FriendFinder

This app allows you to fill out a questionaire and be matched with someone with similar preferences. For the purpose of the homework I have filled the `friends.js` with random celebrities...feel free to load the list with people you may know.


## Overview

The home page of the app serves the purposes of telling you about the app.

Navigating to the `survey` page will present you with a 12 item questionnaire: name, photo link, and 10 questions to determine your fate.

All questions are required.

Clicking submit will generate your match and display it to you in a pop modal.

## Setup

First clone this repo to your local directory.

Next, navigate to your repo in your command terminal, and enter:

`npm install`

This will ensure you have all the necessary NPM packages installed to run this generator.
